Erlson - Erlang Simple Object Notation
======================================

Erlson is a dynamic name-value dictionary data type for Erlang.

Erlson dictionaries come with a convenient syntax and can be directly converted
to and from JSON.

Examples:

```erlang
    % create an empty dictionary
    X = #{},

    % associate fields 'foo' with 1, 'bar' with "abc" and 'fum' with 'true'
    D = #{foo = 1, bar = "abc", fum},

    % access dictionary element
    1 = D.foo,

    % add nested dictionaries to dictionary D
    D1 = D#{baz = #{fum = #{i = 0}}},

    % access elements of the nested dictionary
    0 = D1.baz.fum.i,

    % modify elements of the nested dictionary
    D2 = D1#{baz.fum.i = 100, baz.fum.j = "new nested value"}.

    ...

    % convert Erlson dictionary to JSON iolist()
    erlson:to_json(D2).

    % create Erlson dictionary from JSON iolist()
    D = erlson:from_json(Json).

    ...

    % create Erlson dictionary from a proplist
    D = erlson:from_proplist(L).

    % create nested Erlson dictionary from a nested proplist
    D = erlson:from_nested_proplist(L).

    % create nested Erlson dictionary from a nested proplist up to the maximum
    % depth of 2
    D = erlson:from_nested_proplist(L, 2).
```

General properties
------------------

* Erlson dictionaries contain zero or more Name->Value associations
(fields), where each Name is `atom()` or `binary()` and Value can be of `any()`
type.

* Name->Value associations are unique. If a new association is created for the
existing Name, the old value will be replaced by the new value.

* Erlson dictionaries can be nested.


Runtime properties
------------------

* Only fields with `atom()` names can be accessed using the Erlson
dictionary syntax.

* Unlike Erlang records, Erlson dictionaries can be dynamically constructed
without any static type declarations.

* At runtime, Erlson dictionaries are represented as a list of {Name, Value}
tuples ordered by Name. This way, each Erlson dictionary is a valid `proplist`
and `orddict` in terms of the correspondent stdlib modules.

* Erlson dictionaries (dictionary syntax) can't be used as patterns and in
guard expressions. An error message will be returned by the Erlang compiler
Erlson syntax is used in pattern-matching or guard contexts.

* Erlson dictionaries can be used in both compiled modules and Erlang
interactive shell.


Properties related to JSON
--------------------------

* Each valid JSON object can be converted to correspondent Erlson
dictionary.

* An Erlson dictionary can be converted to JSON if it follows JSON data
model.

* JSON->Erlson->JSON conversion produces an equivalent JSON object
(fields may be reordered). The only exception is `{}` (empty JSON object),
because it can not be directly represented in Erlson when loaded from JSON.

* There is one-to-one mapping between JSON and Erlang/Erlson values:

   * JSON object <-> Erlson dictionary
   * JSON array  <-> Erlang list
   * JSON number <-> Erlang `number()` (i.e. floats and integers)
   * JSON true | false <-> Erlang `boolean()`
   * JSON string value <-> Erlang `binary()`
   * JSON null <-> Erlang atom `undefined`

* JSON field names are decoded using the following function:

    ```erlang
    decode_json_field_name(N) ->
        try binary_to_existing_atom(N, utf8)
        catch
            error:badarg -> N
        end.
    ```

* The `erlson:to_json` function supports quoted JSON values represented as
  `{json, iodata()} Erlang terms. The function will write the `iodata()` part of
  this term directly into JSON output. For example, `{json, "{}"}` Erlson value
  will turn into empty JSON object.


Erlson and property lists
-------------------------

Property list can be converted to Erlson dictionaries using the
`erlson:from_proplist` function and its variations.

Erlson dictionaries can also be used for property lists construction. Using
Erlson, proplists look much cleaner. For example, compare

```erlang
{application, erlson,
 [{description, "Erlang Simple Object Notation"},
  {vsn, git},
  {modules, []},
  {applications, [kernel, stdlib]},
  {env, []}]}.
```

and

```erlang
{application, erlson,
 #{description = "Erlang Simple Object Notation",
   vsn = git,
   modules = [],
   applications = [kernel, stdlib],
   env = []}}.
```


Usage instructions
------------------

For compiled modules that use Erlson syntax, the Erlson library header must be
included:

```erlang
    -include_lib("erlson/include/erlson.hrl").
```

When rebar is used as a build tool, it should be configured to use
"erlson_rebar_plugin". In order to do that, add the following lines to the
project's "rebar.config" file:

```erlang
    {plugins, [erlson_rebar_plugin]}. % for newer rebar
    {rebar_plugins, [erlson_rebar_plugin]}. % for older rebar

    {deps,
        [
            {erlson, "", {git, "https://github.com/alavrik/erlson.git", {branch, "master"}}}
        ]}.
```

In order to use Erlson syntax from Erlang shell, run the following command (e.g.
include it in `.erlang` file):

```erlang
    erlson:init().
```


Limitations
-----------

Erlson relies on modified versions of Erlang parsers taken from correspondent
Erlang/OTP releases. While Erlson is fully compatible with R13, R14 and R15
Erlang releases, compatibility between Erlson and future Erlang versions can not
be guaranteed.

Compatibility can break in one of the following ways:

* Erlang adopts Erlson syntax for natively implemented dynamic dictionaries
  which will make Erlson obsolete.

* Erlang introduces new unrelated syntax elements conflicting with Erlson
  grammar which will make Erlson completely unusable in its current form. In
  response to that, Erlson may adjust its grammar to remain compatible.


Dependencies
------------

Erlson relies on `mochijson2` library for JSON encoding and decoding. It comes
as a part of [Mochiweb](https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb). Erlson doesn't
automatically include it, but if you wish to do it with a rebar-enabled project,
add it as dependency in your `rebar.config`. For example:

```erlang
    {deps,
        [
            % we need Mochiweb for mochijson2
            {mochiweb, "", {git, "https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb.git", {branch, "master"}}}
        ]}.
```
